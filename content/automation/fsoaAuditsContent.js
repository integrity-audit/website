      <h2>BENEFITS OF AUDIT-IQ</h2>
      <p><b>REDUCED AUDIT COSTS</b><br></br>
The audit automation software developed by ITS provides the first level of vouching and reviewing that was traditionally completed by auditors manually. By automating this step, we can to reduce the total amount of audit time required, which reduces the total cost for audits.
<br></br><br></br>
<b>INCREASED AUDIT COVERAGE</b><br></br>
Manual reviews of invoices are slow and time-consuming. Auditors frequently are only able to sample portions of the total invoices under audit. By automating the initial stage of reviewing invoices, there is the potential for significantly more invoices can be reviewed in the same or less time.
<br></br><br></br>
<b>INCREASED ACCURACY</b><br></br>
It is said, “to err is human.” This is another reason why Integrity was driven to develop solutions that leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence. Integrity’s software does not become weary, even after reviewing thousands of invoices in the span of a few hours. This can lead to increases in audit accuracy, as items that may be overlooked by a human are identified by the software and flagged for additional reviews by auditors who have fresh eyes and years of audit experience. This last step, human review, is a crucial step in our process. Human audit experts are capable of additional critical thinking and problem solving, including understanding the invoices in their larger operational context, that is essential for verifying if flagged items can be validated or should be raised as audit exceptions</p>

      <h2>Optimize Your Audits with Audit-iQ</h2>
<p>
On large projects, it can be difficult to obtain meaningful audit scope coverage within a reasonable budget using traditional audit techniques and testing procedures; however, Integrity resolves this problem by complementing the best traditional audit practices with technology. With AiQ, charges can be analyzed using statistical modelling (machine learning) and data analytics. This software provides the first level of detection for coding errors and ineligible charges. 
<br></br><br></br> 
 While the application does not eliminate the need for human auditors, it facilitates the capability to review up to 95% of reviewable documents, compared with only 30-40% of invoices that are reviewed in traditional (manual) audit. As a propriety technology Audit-iQ is exclusively available to Integrity clients and is not available anywhere else in the industry.

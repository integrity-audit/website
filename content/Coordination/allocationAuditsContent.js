    <h2>Audit Responses</h2>
      <p>Without due attention and expertise, valid joint venture audit queries can be closed without proper credit, and invalid queries can be credited when no credit was appropriate. Both scenarios can cost your business money. Further, sometimes joint venture audits go unresolved indefinitely without assistance. Whether you were audited or did the audit, our professionals can help you resolve audits in a timely basis.

      <h2>A Proven Methodology</h2>
<p>The success of our IOGC trucking reviews is due to an approach that combines experience with technology. We use a custom software application that leverages data analytics, AI, and machine learning technologies to make audits more accurate and efficient. This technology reduces audit time, which saves you money and gets results faster. We combine this technology with manual reviews performed by audit professionals. Our auditors specialize in oil and gas auditing and accounting, and they have worked on many IOGC and other oil and gas audits. Our reviews include a determination of the eligibility of the trucking costs as well as an evaluation of the trucking cost allocation methodology.</p>

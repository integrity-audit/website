      <h2>Final Statement of Adjustments (FSOA) Audits</h2>
      <p>Typically 180 days after the Closing Date of an asset disposition, the Vendor prepares a Final Statement of Adjustments (FSOA) to account for all benefits and obligations pertaining to the assets sold. The FSOA accounts for the period between the Closing Date and the Effective Date. FSOA audits are typically very important to conduct, as there are frequently issues, including date errors that may cause the Purchaser to be charged for pre-Effective Date costs that they do not owe.</p>
